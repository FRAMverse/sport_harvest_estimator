As noted in the "About" tab, this application supports the development of preseason coho FRAM fishery inputs for [WDFW marine sport fisheries](https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/basics/salmon/marine-areas) in the Salish Sea.

Given a current R+RStudio installation, clone the repo or download the primary script and associated environment, then select "Run Document" to initiate a local pseudo-server that will load into an Rstudio preview window (or can be opened in an external browser).
